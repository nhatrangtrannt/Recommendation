This notebook is where I practice projects related to recommendation system with the topics as below:

1. **Designing a Content-Based Recommendation System using Python**
    - Understand content-based recommendation system works using a movie dataset from Netflix TV Shows and Movies dataset on Kaggle
    - Read the dataset file using panda's library and ensure all the values are in the correct data types
    - Extract all the genres from the original dataset 
    - Use feature extraction to transform the raw features (genres) into binary features
    - Establish a user profile for training set by converting genres feature to binary outputs, calculating the weighted movie matrix, and calculating the user profile
    - Ranking the candidate movies for Testing set by converting genres feature to binary outputs, calculating the weighted movie matrix, and calculating the recommendation score
      for each movie
    - Sort the scores in a descending order
